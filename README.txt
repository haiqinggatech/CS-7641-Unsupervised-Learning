All data is located/placed in the "data" folder, strip_extra_cols.py strips extra columns and formats the data nicely.

To run code (written in python 2.7):
0) Start in the root directory
1) There is a run_XXX.sh shell script to run each of the different algorithms (this is used to force directory relative paths)
2) Exceptions are added on the first line of computational code for safety when testing (simply remove these lines to run the code (it will be super clear))
3) plotter.py is used to generate useful graphs for the assingment
